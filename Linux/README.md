# My Linux Setup

# Before writing
Before I joined NEUQ-Loongson class, I'd tried some ctf competitions. While having a tough fight with misc, I learned something about virtual machines.

I've spent almost A week to fight with VM. And now, I have a Kali linux for simple ctf misc learning, a Ubuntu for linux daily learning, and a winXP for Assembly learning.(U know that the debug.exe has been removed since win7x86)

So in this Blog, I will only show how I installed Kali Linux, because it's easy to write. And I will show some other details to tell u all I know about Virtual machines and Linux.

# Why use Kali Linux
* I tried some ctf competitions but found that 
doesn't fit me.
* Because it's "jailable and prisonable". 
* Installing it is easy for VM.
* It is COOL, isn't it.

# Steps
## 1. Installing VMWare
There are thouthands of tutorials in CSDN, so I don't want to waste time repeat it.

## 2. Downloading Kali
U can easily find VM packages on [kali.org](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines).

After downloading, unpackage the zip file, then a well prepared virture machine is just there.

## 3. Add Kali into VM

Scan virture machine and then everything is completed.
